# AprilTags with TurtleBot3 Camera

## Tasks
1. **Modify Code for TurtleBot3 Camera**  
   - Ensure that `main.py`, which currently works on a laptop, is modified to function with the TurtleBot3 camera.

2. **Testing `RosVersion.py` on TurtleBot3**  
   - Implement ROS elements and verify that it runs properly on the actual TurtleBot.

## Files
- `main.py` – Currently functional on a laptop.
- `RosVersion.py` – Needs testing with ROS on the TurtleBot.

## Next Steps
- Adapt camera input in `main.py` to work with the TurtleBot3 camera.
- Test and debug `RosVersion.py` directly on the TurtleBot running ROS2.
