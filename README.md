## Tasks
1. **`main.py`**
  - works on laptop using webcam

3. **Testing `RosVersion.py` on TurtleBot3**  
   - Implement ROS elements and verify that it runs properly on the actual TurtleBot.

## Files
- `main.py` – Currently functional on a laptop.
- `RosVersion.py` – Needs testing with ROS on the TurtleBot.

## Next Steps
- Adapt camera input in `main.py` to work with the TurtleBot3 camera.
- Test and debug `RosVersion.py` directly on the TurtleBot running ROS2.
